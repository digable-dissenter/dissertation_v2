## Nomenclature

$P_{win}$

$P_{goal/chance}$

:   *Probability of conceding a goal-scoring chance

$t$

:   *Time variable used in pressing analysis (e.g., time to recover possession)*

$x$

:   *Spatial location on the field (x-coordinate)*

$y$

:   *Spatial location on the field (y-coordinate)*

$w$

:   *Weight or significance of pressing action*

$\mu$

:   *Mean (average pressing intensity or event probability)*

$\sigma$

:   *Variance (to represent variability in pressing effectiveness)*

## Terminology

**ball recovery**

:   the act of regaining possession of the ball, typically following a press or interception.

**batch**

:   subset of training data used in one iteration.

**compactness**

:   the degree to which a team stays close together, minimising space for opponents to exploit.

**counter-attacking**

:   a playing philosophy focused on quickly attacking after regaining possession.

**counter-press**

:   the act of pressing immediately after losing possession, often within a few seconds

**defensive strategies**

:   these include overall approaches like deep-defending (maintaining a compact shape near the goal) and high-press (applying pressure high up the pitch).

**defensive transition**

:   the phase in which a team shifts from attack to defence, often involving immediate pressing to regain possession

**dropout**

:   optimise by randomly dropping out neurons during training

**epoch**

:   one pass through the entire training dataset

**expected Assists (xA)**

:   a measure of the likelihood that a pass will result in a goal

**expected Goals (xG)**

:   a metric that quantifies the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal, based on historical shot data

**expected Threat (xT)**

:   a metric designed to quantify the danger posed by having possession of the ball in a specific location on the pitch (or resulting  from a specific action).

**formation**

:   tactical arrangement of players on the pitch (e.g. 4-4-2, 3-5-2)

**gegenpressing**

:   a high-intensity pressing tactic that emphasises immediate pressure after losing possession to force errors from the opponent

\*\*

:   derivative of cost w.r.t. model parameters

**line-breaking pass**

:   a pass that bypasses one or more defensive lines, putting the opposing team at a tactical disadvantage

**marking**

:   defending players positioning themselves to restrict the movement and passing options of opponents

**optimizer**

:   algorithm used to minimise the cost function

**overfitting**

:   model is memorising the training data and not generalising well to new data

**passing patterns**

:   the sequences and styles of passes between players that are considered part of offensive tactics

**pressing**

:   defensive tactic where players apply pressure on opponents to regain possession quickly

**regularisation**

:   optimisation by adding a penalty term to the loss function

**spatial analysis**

:   analysis that takes into account player positions and movements on the pitch.

**turnover**

:   gaining possession from the opponent, often as a result of successful pressing

**underfitting**

:   model is not able to learn the underlying patterns in the data

**zone-pressing**

:   pressing applied within a specific area or zone of the pitch
