In the early 1990s, the Dutch footballing philosophy was worshipped across the continent. Then the baton passed to the Italians, who clearly boasted Europe’s strongest league. But when France started winning everything at the international level its national academy became the template for others, until suddenly, almost out of nowhere, Europe’s most revered player and manager both hailed from Portugal. Next, Barcelona and Spain won everything during a very obvious four-year period of dominance, before tiki-taka’s decline meant Bayern and Germany took control. Finally, Europe’s most successful coaches found themselves competing in England, introducing a brilliant cacophony of styles to the Premier League.

Zonal Marking is a glorious travelogue through soccer’s triumphant styles and characters.},

Taking into account that pressing is not limited to turning over the ball, but is also connected to stopping events from happening, such as a pass being attempted through intelligent positioning, the three KPIs include a ball recovery score, an interception opportunity score and a surface covering score, with scores for all three metrics being calculated at each stage of an opposition’s build-up play. These outputs can help a team objectively evaluate the effectiveness of each player during their coordinated pressing actions, informing development and refining future pressing execution.

	abstract = {The analysis of tracking data in tactical game analysis is a topic of rising interest, as more detailed insights into performance structure in soccer can be obtained compared to traditional (e.g. notational) analyzes. Compared to the variety and detailed analyzes of offensive play, the number of studies analyzing the defensive play is low. However, in recent years, an increasing number of studies investigating defensive play have been published, so it seems useful to provide an overview of the current state of research in this area. Therefore, this study aims to identify the approaches that have been used to analyze the defensive play in professional soccer using player tracking data and to reveal the findings on successful defensive play. A systematic literature search of electronic databases (PubMed (n = 604), Web of Science (n = 593), and SPORTDiscuss (n = 872)) was conducted according to the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies that were included used tracking data of professional adult male soccer and analyzed defensive play. The result is a total of 23 studies that were analyzed in detail using the standardized quality assessment checklist for systematic reviews in sports science. The synthesis of results was carried out descriptively by organizing the results into different levels of tactical play (individual level, group level, team level). All included studies were of good methodological quality. The approaches to investigate defensive play using tracking data are highly heterogeneous (e.g. analysis of defensive pressure, analysis of synchronization, behavioral analyzes, ball recoveries). Successful defensive play is characterized by high pressure at the individual level, by high inter-team and intra-team synchronization and balanced defense at the group level, and by a compact coordinated organization at the team level. By summarizing the state of research on defensive play in soccer using sophisticated analysis approaches that showcase the possibilities of tracking data, this study provides an important foundation for future research in this area.},

Match analysis in professional football has predominately utilised notational analysis, a statistical summary of events based on video footage, to study the sport and prepare teams for competition. Recent increases in technology have facilitated the dynamic analysis of more complex process variables, giving practitioners the potential to quickly evaluate a match with consideration to contextual parameters. One field of research, known as machine learning, is a form of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns based on positional data. Machine learning is a relatively new concept in football, and little is known about its usefulness in identifying performance metrics that determine match outcome. Few studies and no reviews have focused on the use of machine learning to improve tactical knowledge and performance, instead focusing on the models used, or as a prediction method. Accordingly, this article provides a critical appraisal of the application of machine learning in football related to attacking play, discussing current challenges and future directions that may provide deeper insight to practitioners.},

	abstract = {The game of soccer is complex and unpredictable, demanding multifaceted strategies for success. Performance analysis has evolved, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) to determine the factors that most significantly influence a team’s success or failure during matches. Traditional performance analysis methods have emphasized quantifiable data like physical exertion and basic play events but often neglected the subtler tactical dimensions that could significantly impact game outcomes. This study aimed to fill the gap in the current literature by creating a comprehensive framework that incorporates tactical situations as KPIs. The objective was to examine whether specific playing styles adopted by teams in various tactical situations and phases of the game could predict the outcome of matches. A dataset comprising all First Division Championship matches from 11 different European countries for the 2021–2022 season was analyzed. Variables representing tactical situations were correlated with match outcomes using a Generalized Estimating Equation framework. The model was specified with a binomial distribution and a logit link function. Statistical significance was determined using Wald χ2 tests with a significance level set at p {\textless} 0.05. The study’s findings revealed that possession style, counterattacking during offensive transitions, and a balanced aggressive defensive strategy significantly increase a team’s chances of victory. It also showed that successful teams tend to focus on central attacks, minimize crossing, and execute strategic plays that lead to final attempts on goal with minimal ball possession. The above findings demonstrate that adopting certain tactical approaches significantly influences soccer match outcomes, highlighting the importance of considering tactical aspects as KPIs.},

	abstract = {Modern movement tracking technologies enable acquisition of high quality data about movements of the players and the ball in the course of a football match. However, there is a big difference between the raw data and the insights into team behaviors that analysts would like to gain. To enable such insights, it is necessary first to establish relationships between the concepts characterizing behaviors and what can be extracted from data. This task is challenging since the concepts are not strictly defined. We propose a computational approach to detecting and quantifying the relationships of pressure emerging during a game. Pressure is exerted by defending players upon the ball and the opponents. Pressing behavior of a team consists of multiple instances of pressure exerted by the team members. The extracted pressure relationships can be analyzed in detailed and summarized forms with the use of static and dynamic visualizations and interactive query tools. To support examination of team tactics in different situations, we have designed and implemented a novel interactive visual tool “time mask”. It enables selection of multiple disjoint time intervals in which given conditions are fulfilled. Thus, it is possible to select game situations according to ball possession, ball distance to the goal, time that has passed since the last ball possession change or remaining time before the next change, density of players’ positions, or various other conditions. In response to a query, the analyst receives visual and statistical summaries of the set of selected situations and can thus perform joint analysis of these situations. We give examples of applying the proposed combination of computational, visual, and interactive techniques to real data from games in the German Bundesliga, where the teams actively used pressing in their defense tactics.},

	abstract = {Until recently tactical analysis in elite soccer were based on observational data using variables which discard most contextual information. Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon.},

	abstract = {In fluid team sports such as soccer and basketball, analyzing team formation is one of the most intuitive ways to understand tactics from domain participants' point of view. However, existing approaches either assume that team formation is consistent throughout a match or assign formations frame-by-frame, which disagree with real situations. To tackle this issue, we propose a change-point detection framework named SoccerCPD that distinguishes tactically intended formation and role changes from temporary changes in soccer matches. We first assign roles to players frame-by-frame and perform two-step change-point detections: (1) formation change-point detection based on the sequence of role-adjacency matrices and (2) role change-point detection based on the sequence of role permutations. The evaluation of SoccerCPD using the ground truth annotated by domain experts shows that our method accurately detects the points of tactical changes and estimates the formation and role assignment per segment. Lastly, we introduce practical use-cases that domain participants can easily interpret and utilize.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse footballers' tactical behaviours from their position data, as an effect of two contrasting pressing strategies, high-press defending and deep-defending, using a trial-based experimental approach. Sixty-nine youth footballers participated in this 11 versus 11 study, performing 72 trials of attack versus defence, in a counterbalanced crossover study design. Players' position data were captured using a local positioning system, and processed to calculate measures of inter-team distance, trial duration, distance to nearest opponent, dispersion, team length, team width, team shape, space control gain, inter-line distance, and individual area. This was augmented by the notational analyses of passes. The findings showed that using a high-press defending strategy leads to: closer inter-team distance; larger dispersion, due to a longer team length; and larger inter-line distances between defenders, midfielders, and forwards. The resulting effects on the attacking team include reduced ball possession time; larger individual areas for attacking midfielders and forwards; longer team length; and more penetrative passes performed. Some differences in marking behaviour were also observed. Consequently, the study recommends that high-press defending be used sparingly due to these trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Football tactics is a topic of public interest, where decisions are predominantly made based on gut instincts from domain-experts. Sport science literature often highlights the need for evidence-based research on football tactics, however the limited capabilities in modeling the dynamics of football has prevented researchers from gaining usable insights. Recent technological advances have made high quality football data more available and affordable. Particularly, positional data providing player and ball coordinates at every instance of a match can be combined with event data containing spatio-temporal information on any event taking place on the pitch (e.g. passes, shots, fouls). On the other hand, the application of machine learning methods to domain-specific problems yields a paradigm shift in many industries including sports. The need for more informed decisions as well as automating time consuming processes—accelerated by the availability of data—has motivated many scientific investigations in football analytics. This thesis is part of a research program combining methodologies from sports and data science to address the following problems: the synchronization of positional and event data, objectively quantifying offensive actions, as well as the detection of tactical patterns. Although various basic insights from the overall research program are integrated, this thesis focuses primarily on the latter one. Specifically, positional and event data are used to apply machine learning techniques to identify eight established tactical patterns in football: namely high-/mid-/low-block defending, build-up/attacking play in the offense, counterpressing and counterattacks during transitions, and patterns when defending corner-kicks, e.g. player-/zonal- or post-marking. For each pattern, we consolidate definitions with football experts and label large amounts of data manually using video recordings. The inter-labeler reliability is used to ensure that each pattern is well-defined. Unsupervised techniques are used for the purpose of exploration, and supervised machine learning methods based on expert-labeled data for the final detection. As an outlook, semi-supervised methods were used to reduce the labeling effort. This thesis proves that the detection of tactical patterns can optimize everyday processes in professional clubs, and leverage the domain of tactical analysis in sport science by gaining unseen insights. Additionally, we add value to the machine learning domain by evaluating recent methods in supervised and semi supervised machine learning on challenging, real-world problems.},

	title = {A {Graph} {Neural} {Network} {Deep}-{Dive} into {Successful} {Counterattacks}},
	abstract = {A counterattack in soccer is a high speed, high intensity direct attack that can occur when a team transitions from a defensive state to an attacking state after regaining possession of the ball. The aim is to create a goal-scoring opportunity by covering a lot of ground with minimal passes before the opposing team can recover their defensive shape. The purpose of this research is to build gender-specific, first-of-their-kind Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a counterattack being successful and uncover what factors make them successful in both men's and women's professional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20,863 frames of algorithmically identified counterattacking sequences from synchronized StatsPerform on-ball event data and SkillCorner spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. This dataset is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international women’s soccer (2020-2022). With this data we demonstrate that gender-specific Graph Neural Networks outperform architecturally identical gender-ambiguous models in predicting the successful outcome of counterattacks. We show, using Permutation Feature Importance, that byline to byline speed, angle to the goal, angle to the ball and sideline to sideline speed are the node features with the highest impact on model performance.
Additionally, we offer some illustrative examples on how to navigate the infinite solution search space to aid in identifying improvements for player decision making. This research is accompanied by a GitHub repository of all data and Python code to allow the reader to replicate and improve upon our research.},

	abstract = {While the tactical behavior of soccer players differs between specific phases of play (offense, defense, offensive transition, defensive transition), little is known about successful behavior of players during defensive transition (switching behavior from offense to defense). Therefore, this study aims to analyze the group tactic of rest defense (despite in ball possession, certain players safeguard quick counterattacks in case of ball loss) in defensive transition. A mixed-methods approach was used, involving both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Semi-structured expert interviews with seven professional soccer coaches were conducted to define rest defense. In the quantitative analysis, several KPIs were calculated, based on tracking and event data of 153 games of the 2020/21 German Bundesliga season, to predict the success of rest defense situations in a machine learning approach. The qualitative interviews indicated that rest defense can be defined as the positioning of the deepest defenders during ball possession to prevent an opposing counterattack after a ball loss. For instance, the rest defending players created a numerical superiority of 1.69 ± 1.00 and allowed a space control of the attacking team of 11.51 ± 9.82 [\%] in the area of rest defense. The final machine learning model showed satisfactory prediction performance of the success of rest defense (Accuracy: 0.97, Precision: 0.73, f1-Score: 0.64, AUC: 0.60). Analysis of the individual KPIs revealed insights into successful behavior of players in rest defense, including controlling deep spaces and dangerous counterattackers. The study concludes regaining possession as fast as possible after a ball loss is the most important success factor in defensive transition., 
Key pointsCombination of qualitative expert interviews and up-to-date quantitative data analysis using tracking data and machine learning revealed insightful results of successful tactical behavior in defensive transition in soccerAccording to experts, rest defense can be defined as behavior of the deepest defending players during ball possession with the goal to prevent an opposing counterattack after a ball loss during defensive transitionTo be successful in defensive transition, players in rest defense should control deep spaces and dangerous counterattackers to successfully prevent dangerous opposing counterattacksMost important success criterion in defensive transition is to regain possession after a ball loss as quickly as possible to stop an opponent’s counterattack in the early stages},

	abstract = {The interest in tactical analysis in soccer has increased in the latest years, especially with the growing availability of player tracking data. With it, the defending team's compact organization, which is considered by practitioners to be an important factor in defense, was repeatedly examined. However, the connection between this defensive principle of play and the defending success remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relation of the principle of playing defensive compact organization to the success of the defense. Based on tracking and event data of 153 games of the German Bundesliga (season 2020/21), the compactness (surface area, spread of the team, and of defending subgroups) and the organization (distances between formation lines) of the defending team was compared between successful and unsuccessful defensive plays. There were almost no differences in the compactness of the whole team, and the organizational measures between successful and unsuccessful defensive plays. The defending subgroup of five defenders closest to the ball showed a higher compactness (smaller surface area and smaller spread) in successful defensive plays compared to unsuccessful ones (−0.08 ≤ d ≤ −0.16). Our results indicate that the compactness of players in areas close to the ball seems crucial for defensive success. However, the compact organization of the entire team does not seem important to regain the ball in defense.},

Together with machine learning approaches one can obtain deeper and more objective insights into the performance structure. In soccer, the analysis of the defense was neglected in comparison to the offense. Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict ball gains in defense using tracking data to identify tactical variables that drive defensive success. We evaluated tracking data of 153 games of German Bundesliga season 2020/21. With it, we derived player (defensive pressure, distance to the ball, \& velocity) and team metrics (inter-line distances, numerical superiority, surface area, \& spread) each containing a tactical idea. Afterwards, we trained supervised machine learning classifiers (logistic regression, XGBoost, \& Random Forest Classifier) to predict successful (ball gain) vs. unsuccessful defensive plays (no ball gain). The expert-reduction-model (Random Forest Classifier with 16 features) showed the best and satisfying prediction performance (F1-Score (test) = 0.57). Analyzing the most important input features of this model, we are able to identify tactical principles of defensive play that appear to be related to gaining the ball: press the ball leading player, create numerical superiority in areas close to the ball (press short pass options), compact organization of defending team. Those principles are highly interesting for practitioners to gain valuable insights in the tactical behavior of soccer players that may be related to the success of defensive play.},

The TRP variables included total distance covered, low-intensity running (\&lt;4 m/s), running (4-5.5 m/s), high speed running (5.5-7 m/s) and sprinting (\&gt;7 m/s). The TTP variables included total actions shots on target, passes, key passes, crosses, dribbles, final third entries and penalty area entries. Results from linear mixed model indicated that (i) TRP was similar irrespective to number of successful pressings (t=-0.13 to 0.67, all p\&gt;0.05, all trivial to small effects sizes), (ii) TTP tend to increase when higher rate of successful team pressings was utilized (t=2.33 to 5.18, all p\&lt;0.05, all large effects sizes). These results show significant influence of team pressing on TTP and no influence of team pressing on TRP, suggesting that cooperative and well-organised interaction between players is more important factor of team pressing than pure physical performance.

The sample consisted of 1323 situations of defensive ball possession of the semi-finalist teams from the 2014 FIFA World Cup play-offs, which was collected by a valid and reliable observational instrument (Soccer-Defence). The Kruskal-Wallis H, Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, Z-, multinomial logistic regression tests and sequential analysis (p {\textless} .05; z {\textgreater} 1.96) were used accordingly to test the differences and associations among and within teams of tactical modelling, tactical-technical behaviours and contextual variables to ball recovery. We found that among teams ball recovery differed in duration; H(3) = 14.958, p = .002. Germany were more likely to perform ball recovery by the goalkeeper than Argentina (p = .04; OR = 0.47) or the Netherlands (p {\textless} .05; OR = 0.50). Nevertheless, Brazil was the least likely to concede a shot off goal. Teams facing lower-ranked opponents were 0.63 times less likely to perform ball recovery by interception (p {\textless}.001). Additionally, sequential analysis illustrated that teams varied between central and lateral high-pressure zones before ball recovery in lower zones of the field. Finally, coaches could use such findings to design training exercises, create their own style of play, and set strategies.},

However, few studies investigated defensive tactical variables during match-play and the influence of contextual variables on them. The aims of the present study were (1) to examine the defensive behaviors of soccer teams when gaining the ball in advanced zones of the pitch and (2) to evaluate the effect of contextual variables on these defensive behaviors. A sample of 1,095 defensive pieces of play initiated in the opposing half of the pitch obtained from 10 matches of the season 2010/11 of La Liga and involving 13 teams was collected using the semiautomated tracking system Amisco Pro. Five defensive tactical variables, the outcome of defensive pieces of play, and contextual variables (i.e., match status, venue, quality of opposition, and match period) were recorded for every defensive piece initiated in the opposing half of the pitch. Results showed that there were significant differences among teams in the outcome of defensive pieces of play originating from the opposing half (χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 111.87, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.01, φ$_{\textrm{c}}$ = 0.22), and in the outcome of offensive pieces of play following ball gains (χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 49.92, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001, φ$_{\textrm{c}}$ = 0.22). Cluster analysis revealed four groups describing different defensive behaviors from high-pressure to a defense close to their own goal. Match status (χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 25.87, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05, φ$_{\textrm{c}}$ = 0.11) and quality of opposition (χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 21.19, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05, φ$_{\textrm{c}}$ = 0.10) were the contextual variables that showed a significant effect on defensive pieces of play initiated in the opposite half of the pitch. Teams winning gained more balls in the zone close to their own goal, and losing teams gained more balls in advanced zones of the pitch. Moreover, the greater the quality of the opponent the lesser the chance of gaining the ball in advanced zones of the pitch. Neither venue or match period influenced the defensive pieces of play analyzed.

	abstract = {In professional soccer, increasing amounts of data are collected that harness great potential when it comes to analysing tactical behaviour. Unlocking this potential is difficult as big data challenges the data management and analytics methods commonly employed in sports. By joining forces with computer science, solutions to these challenges could be achieved, helping sports science to find new insights, as is happening in other scientific domains. We aim to bring multiple domains together in the context of analysing tactical behaviour in soccer using position tracking data. A systematic literature search for studies employing position tracking data to study tactical behaviour in soccer was conducted in seven electronic databases, resulting in 2338 identified studies and finally the inclusion of 73 papers. Each domain clearly contributes to the analysis of tactical behaviour, albeit in – sometimes radically – different ways. Accordingly, we present a multidisciplinary framework where each domain’s contributions to feature construction, modelling and interpretation can be situated. We discuss a set of key challenges concerning the data analytics process, specifically feature construction, spatial and temporal aggregation. Moreover, we discuss how these challenges could be resolved through multidisciplinary collaboration, which is pivotal in unlocking the potential of position tracking data in sports analytics.},

To date, studies in football analytics have mainly focused on the attacking side of the game, while there has been less work on event-driven metrics for valuing defensive actions (e.g., tackles and interceptions). Therefore in this paper, we use deep learning techniques to define a novel metric that values such defensive actions by studying the threat of passages of play that preceded them. By doing so, we are able to value defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our Defensive Action Expected Threat (DAxT) model has been validated using real-world event-data from the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 English Premier League seasons, and we combine our model outputs with additional features to derive an overall rating of defensive ability for players. Overall, we find that our model is able to predict the impact of defensive actions allowing us to better value defenders using event-data.},

	abstract = {Detecting counterpressing is an important task for any professional match-analyst in football (soccer), but is being done exclusively manually by observing video footage. The purpose of this paper is not only to automatically identify this strategy, but also to derive metrics that support coaches with the analysis of transition situations. Additionally, we want to infer objective influence factors for its success and assess the validity of peer-created rules of thumb established in by practitioners. Based on a combination of positional and event data we detect counterpressing situations as a supervised machine learning task. Together, with professional match-analysis experts we discussed and consolidated a consistent definition, extracted 134 features and manually labeled more than 20, 000 defensive transition situations from 97 professional football matches. The extreme gradient boosting model—with an area under the curve of \$\$87.4{\textbackslash}\%\$\$on the labeled test data—enabled us to judge how quickly teams can win the ball back with counterpressing strategies, how many shots they create or allow immediately afterwards and to determine what the most important success drivers are. We applied this automatic detection on all matches from six full seasons of the German Bundesliga and quantified the defensive and offensive consequences when applying counterpressing for each team. Automating the task saves analysts a tremendous amount of time, standardizes the otherwise subjective task, and allows to identify trends within larger data-sets. We present an effective way of how the detection and the lessons learned from this investigation are integrated effectively into common match-analysis processes.},

	abstract = {Recently, the availability of big amounts of data enables analysts to dive deeper into the constraints of performance in various team sports. While offensive analyses in football have been extensively conducted, the evaluation of defensive performance is underrepresented in this sport. Hence, the aim of this study was to analyze successful defensive playing phases by investigating the space and time characteristics of defensive pressure. Therefore, tracking and event data of 153 games of the German Bundesliga (second half of 2020/21 season) were assessed. Defensive pressure was measured in the last 10 seconds of a defensive playing sequence (time characteristic) and it was distinguished between pressure on the ball-carrier, pressure on the group (5 attackers closest to the ball), and pressure on the whole team (space characteristic). A linear mixed model was applied to evaluate the effect of success of a defensive play (ball gain), space characteristic, and time characteristic on defensive pressure. Defensive pressure is higher in successful defensive plays (14.47 ± 16.82[\%]) compared to unsuccessful defensive plays (12.87 ± 15.31[\%]). The characteristics show that defensive pressure is higher in areas closer to the ball (space characteristic) and the closer the measurement is to the end of a defensive play (time characteristic), which is especially true for successful defensive plays. Defensive pressure is a valuable key performance indicator for defensive play. Further, this study shows that there is an association between the pressing of the ball-carrier and areas close to the ball with the success of defensive play.},

The sample consisted of 10 U16 teams, 16 U18 teams and 16 First teams. The study found that there were significant differences in playing styles across the age groups. As experience increases, there is a tendency of more wing than central attacks, more forward-diagonal movements, more crosses, but fewer shooting opportunities due to developments in defence abilities. The differences in the patterns of play across the age groups, suggests that younger players are more independently focused when attempting to breakdown their opposition’s defence, with older teams using space more effectively and more team focused.},

	abstract = {Sports teams are nowadays collecting huge amounts of data from training sessions and matches. The teams are becoming increasingly interested in exploiting these data to gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. One of the most prevalent types of new data is event stream data from matches. These data enable more advanced descriptive analysis as well as the potential to investigate an opponent's tactics in greater depth. Due to the complexity of both the data and game strategy, most tactical analyses are currently performed by humans reviewing video and scouting matches in person. As a result, this is a time-consuming and tedious process. This paper explores the problem of automatic tactics detection from event-stream data collected from professional soccer matches. We highlight several important challenges that these data and this problem setting pose. We describe a data-driven approach for identifying patterns of movement that account for both spatial and temporal information which represent potential offensive tactics. We evaluate our approach on the 2015/2016 season of the English Premier League and are able to identify interesting strategies per team related to goal kicks, corners and set pieces.},

In this work, we develop a new approach to evaluating all types of soccer actions from play-by-play event data. Our approach utilizes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model to learn an action-value Q-function. To our knowledge, this is the first action-value function based on DRL methods for a comprehensive set of soccer actions. Our neural architecture fits continuous game context signals and sequential features within a play with two stacked LSTM towers, one for the home team and one for the away team separately. To validate the model performance, we illustrate both temporal and spatial projections of the learned Q-function, and conduct a calibration experiment to study the data fit under different game contexts. Our novel soccer Goal Impact Metric (GIM) applies values from the learned Q-function, to measure a player’s overall performance by the aggregate impact values of his actions over all the games in a season. To interpret the impact values, a mimic regression tree is built to find the game features that influence the values most. As an application of our GIM metric, we conduct a case study to rank players in the English Football League Championship. Empirical evaluation indicates GIM is a temporally stable metric, and its correlations with standard measures of soccer success are higher than that computed with other state-of-the-art soccer metrics.},

	abstract = {Deciding on effective team strategies and tactics is fundamental to successful performance in soccer (Carling, Williams, \& Reilly, 2005). Previous research showed that performance indicators such as passes, shots, or ball regains are useful variables that measure tactical performance of teams in match-play (Hughes \& Bartlett, 2002). The influence of contextual variables on these performance indicators and the analysis of their associations with successful team performances have been widely studied (Almeida, Ferreira, \& Volossovitch, 2014; Castellano, Casamichana, \& Lago, 2012; Lago, 2009; Taylor, Mellalieu, James, \& Shearer, 2008). However, no previous research has analysed these aspects in styles of play. Styles of play are tactical behaviours that soccer teams employ in competition (Hewitt, Greenham, \& Norton, 2016), and due to difficulties with measuring them, studies analysing them are scarce. Therefore, the evaluation of styles of play in soccer is an area of interest in performance analysis research. The aims of the present Doctoral Thesis were to identify the styles of play that teams employ in elite soccer and their characteristics, examine how contextual variables (i.e. match status, venue, quality of opposition) influence styles of play used by teams, and evaluate the effectiveness of styles of play under different circumstances in competition.

The findings of this Doctoral Thesis showed that styles of play can be identified in soccer from match data using factor analysis. The analysis of 97 games from the Spanish La Liga and the English Premier League from the seasons 2006–2007 and 2010–2011 using a computerised match analysis system demonstrated that attacking and defensive styles of play can be determined through measuring tactical variables of teams and conducting factor analysis in order to cluster variables and obtain styles of play used by teams. In addition, a qualitative approach through expert coach interviews identified different attacking, defensive, and transition styles of play, and their characteristics. Furthermore, they provided insight into possible metrics that could more accurately measure styles of play.

Moreover, contextual variables influenced a team’s styles of play and changed their behaviour under certain circumstances during the game. The 380 games of the English Premier League from the 2015-2016 season were analysed and showed that match status, venue, and quality of opposition influenced styles of play. Furthermore, the same sample was analysed to determine the effectiveness of styles of play and how the effectiveness changed according to the contextual variables.

In conclusion, the styles of play used by teams in match-play and their characteristics can be identified in soccer. Contextual variables influence the use and effectiveness of these styles of play during competition. These findings could be useful for coaches and other practitioners when analysing or predicting tactical behaviours of soccer teams.},

	abstract = {A major task of sports analytics is to rank players based on the impact of their actions. Recent methods have applied reinforcement learning (RL) to assess the value of actions from a learned action value or Q-function. A fundamental challenge for estimating action values is that explicit reward signals (goals) are very sparse in many team sports, such as ice hockey and soccer. This paper combines Q-function learning with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to provide a novel player ranking method. We treat professional play as expert demonstrations for learning an implicit reward function. Our method alternates single-agent IRL to learn a reward function for multiple agents; we provide a theoretical justification for this procedure. Knowledge transfer is used to combine learned rewards and observed rewards from goals. Empirical evaluation, based on 4.5M play-by-play events in the National Hockey League (NHL), indicates that player ranking using the learned rewards achieves high correlations with standard success measures and temporal consistency throughout a season.},

Therefore, we built a simple and transparent model that mimics the output of the original deep learning model and represents the learned knowledge in an explicit interpretable way. Our mimic model is a linear model tree, which combines a collection of linear models with a regression-tree structure. The tree version of a neural network achieves high fidelity, explains itself, and produces insights for expert stakeholders such as athletes and coaches. We propose and compare several scalable model tree learning heuristics to address the computational challenge from datasets with millions of data points.},

Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1{\textbackslash}\% and 3.4{\textbackslash}\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Soccer scouts typically ignore the team balance and team chemistry when evaluating potential signings for their teams. Instead, they focus on the individual qualities of the players in isolation. To overcome this limitation of their recruitment process, this paper takes a first step towards objectively providing insight into the question: How well does a team of soccer players gel? We address that question in both an observational and a predictive setting. In the former setting, we observe the chemistry between players who have actually played together, which is relevant when selecting the best possible line-up for a match. In the latter setting, we predict the chemistry between players who have never played together before, which is particularly relevant to assess the fit of a potential signing with the players who are already on the team. We introduce two chemistry metrics that measure the offensive and defensive chemistry for a pair of players, respectively. The offensive chemistry metric measures the pair's joint performance in terms of scoring goals, whereas the defensive chemistry metric measures their joint performance in preventing their opponents from scoring goals. We compute our metrics for 361 seasons in 106 different competitions and present a number of concrete use cases. For instance, we show that the partnership between Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in Liverpool's 2017/2018 Champions League campaign exhibited the highest mutual chemistry between two players. Furthermore, we show that Mesut {\textbackslash}"Ozil's chemistry has rapidly started declining following Alexis S{\textbackslash}'anchez' departure to Manchester United in 2018.},

	abstract = {Objectively quantifying a soccer player’s contributions within a match is a challenging and crucial task in soccer analytics. Many of the currently available metrics focus on measuring the quality of shots and assists only, although these represent less than 1\% of all on-the-ball actions. Most recently, several approaches were proposed to bridge this gap. By valuing how actions increase or decrease the likelihood of yielding a goal, these models are effective tools for quantifying the performances of players for all sorts of actions. However, we lack an understanding of their differences, both conceptually and in practice. Therefore, this paper critically compares two such models: expected threat (xT) and valuing actions by estimating probabilities (VAEP). Both approaches exhibit variety in their design choices, that leads to different top player rankings and major differences in how they value speciﬁc actions.},

	title = {Interpretable {Prediction} of {Goals} in {Soccer}},
	abstract = {Valuing the actions a soccer player performs in a match is a crucial problem in soccer analytics. While many approaches have been proposed for this problem, a commonality among them is the need to build a model that can predict for a given game state the probability of a goal occurring in the near future. Often these works have two common shortcomings. First, the predictive models are often not thoroughly evaluated or may even be evaluated according to the wrong performance metric. Second, there is a tendency to sacriﬁce interpretability for performance. Hence, the models often yield no insight into why a given game state has a higher or lower probability of resulting in a goal. This paper analyzes VAEP, a recently proposed approach for valuing actions, and its model for estimating the probability of scoring in the near future. We discuss a number of design choices related to building this model and share insights on how to properly evaluate it. Finally, we replace VAEP’s complicated noninterpretable gradient boosting tree model that uses 151 features with a simpler interpretable Generalized Additive Model (GAM) using only 10 features. We ﬁnd that the GAM oﬀers nearly identical performance to the more complicated gradient boost model while being interpretable and oﬀering insights into what characteristics of a game state have an eﬀect on the probability of scoring a goal in the near future.},

The nature of team sports like soccer, halfway between the abstraction of a game and the reality of complex social systems, combined with the unique size and composition of this dataset, provide an ideal ground for tackling a wide range of data science problems, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, both at individual and at collective level, and the determinants of success and failure.},

The Possession Effectiveness Index, based on Expected Goals and Ball Movement Points metrics, was used to measure the effectiveness of team possessions. Linear mixed models were applied to analyse the influence of contextual variables on the effectiveness score for each style. Results showed that the effectiveness of Direct Play, Counterattack, Maintenance and Crossing significantly increased when teams were winning by two or more goals. Counterattack increased its effectiveness when teams were winning by one goal and reduced its effectiveness when losing by one goal. The effectiveness of Direct Play increased when losing by two goals or more. Playing away negatively affected the effectiveness of Direct Play, Maintenance and High Pressure. In addition, playing against a stronger opposition reduced the effectiveness of all styles of play. The results suggest that the effectiveness of styles of play changes under specific circumstances and that not all contextual variables affect them in the same way.},

	abstract = {Time–motion analysis is a valuable data-collection technique used to quantify the physical match performance of elite soccer players. For over 40 years, researchers have adopted a “traditional” approach when evaluating match demands by simply reporting the distance covered or time spent along a motion continuum of walking through to sprinting. This methodology quantifies physical metrics in isolation without integrating other factors, and this ultimately leads to a 1-dimensional insight into match performance. Thus, this commentary proposes a novel “integrated” approach that focuses on a sensitive physical metric such as high-intensity running but contextualizes this in relation to key tactical activities for each position and collectively for the team. In the example presented, the integrated model clearly unveils the unique high-intensity profile that exists due to distinct tactical roles, rather than 1-dimensional “blind” distances produced by traditional models. Intuitively, this innovative concept may aid coaches’ understanding of the physical performance in relation to the tactical roles and instructions given to the players. In addition, it will enable practitioners to effectively translate match metrics into training and testing protocols. This innovative model may well aid advances in other team sports that incorporate similar intermittent movements with tactical purpose. Evidence of the merits and application of this new concept is needed before the scientific community accepts this model as it may well add complexity to an area that conceivably needs simplicity.},

	abstract = {Abstract AIMS The aim of this study was to explore the effects of a deep-defending vs high-press defending strategy on footballers’ tactical behaviour, physical and physiological responses, when in numerical difference. METHODS Nineteen elite professional footballers (outfield players) participated in this study, playing an 11vs10 match (simulating an early dismissal) for two halves of 10 minutes on a full-sized regulation pitch. The 11-men team was instructed by the head coach to defend closer to goal in the first half (deep-defending) and then defend higher up the pitch in the second half (high-press). Players’ positional data were used to calculate the distance between team centroids, players’ distance to own and to opponent centroid, teams’ effective playing space (EPS), teams’ length per width ratio, distance covered and player velocity. Heart rate was measured via short-range radio telemetry. RESULTS Relative-phase analysis of teams’ EPS showed 61.6\% of anti-phase synchronisation pattern (i.e. the values change in opposite directions) in the deep-defending game. In the high-press game, teams’ centroid distances were closer (\% difference in means; ±90\% CL, -21.0\%; ±9.5\%), while players’ distances to own and opponent centroids were 20\% more regular. Distance covered (-19.8\%; ±2.5\%), player velocity (-20.0\%; ±2.5\%) and heart rates also decreased in the high-press game. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that, adopting a high-press defending strategy can elicit closer centroid distances, more regular movement patterns, decreased synchronisation patterns of EPS, lower distance covered, lower player velocity, and lower heart rates. Coaches may also consider adopting a high-press strategy, when in numerical superiority, to decrease players’ physical and physiological demands.},

To support a wide set of strategies, our goal is to identify situations from data, in an unsupervised way without making use of pre-defined soccer specific concepts such as “pass” or “dribble”. The recurrent neural networks we use in our approach act as a high-dimensional projection of the recent history of a situation on the field. Similar situations, i.e., with similar histories, are found by clustering of network states. The same networks are also used to learn so-called conceptors, that are lower- dimensional manifolds that describe trajectories through a high-dimensional state space that enable situation-specific predictions from the same neural network. With the proposed approach, we can segment games into sequences of situations that are learnt in an unsupervised way, and learn conceptors that are useful for the prediction of the near future of the respective situation.},

Therefore, the consistency of this performance indicator during a match and its balanced distribution in the field zones can be one of the distinct characteristics of successful soccer teams. This study aims to investigate the performance consistency of ball recovery during a match within several time periods (6 periods of 15 min) and zones (four zones). To this end, observational methodology and software Focus X2 were adopted to evaluate 28 matches of semi-final teams at FIFA 2014 including Germany, Argentina, Netherlands, and Brazil in terms of ball recovery frequency. In total, 3222 performances were recorded. All teams in each match and in whole competition had homogeneity of distribution of ball recovery during the time periods (χ23 =1.597, p=0.66). The results of time-zone evaluation indicated that Netherlands and Brazil teams did not have performance consistency on all field zones (χ215=31.29, p=0.008 and χ215 =37.53, p=0.001, respectively). Most ball recoveries were made in the defensive and middle-defensive zones in accordance with modern soccer. It was found that for a soccer team to be successful, it requires a space distribution of experienced players in the field, which leads to power balance for redesigning a team to be offensive in all zones.},

Using heatmaps of pass locations as features, we achieved a mean accuracy of 87\% in a 20-team classification task. We also investigated using pass locations over the course of a possession to predict shots. For this task, we achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.785.

	abstract = {In soccer, the offensive style of play describes characteristic behavioral features of the players at team level during the offensive phase of matches. This study aimed to investigate the effect of offensive playing style (i.e., while in ball possession) on physical and technical match performance during offensive play as well as success-related factors. The sample consisted of official tracking and event data of 153 matches of the 2020/21 German Bundesliga season. For every team in every match an offensive playing style coefficient was calculated to locate teams on a continuum between ball possession and counter-attacking style. This calculation contains 11 technical and physical performance parameters and has already been validated. In addition, dependent physical (e.g., sprinting distance), technical (e.g., passes), and success-related (e.g., goals) variables were examined. A separate linear mixed model was calculated for each dependent variable. While teams with lower playing style coefficient values (= counter-attacking style) covered more high-intensity (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.13) and sprinting distances per second in possession (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.14), teams with higher playing style coefficient values (= ball possession style) were physically more demanded over a whole match (e.g., more accelerations (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.69), decelerations (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.69), high-intensity (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.36), sprint distance (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.08)). Furthermore, teams with higher playing style coefficient values played more horizontal passes (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.73) and revealed better passing success rates (p ≤ 0.01; R2 = 0.17). In contrast, teams with lower playing style coefficient values played more long passes (p {\textless} 0.01; R2 = 0.58). The influence of the playing style coefficient on success-related variables was smaller (p ≤ 0.36; R2 = 0.10–0.13). Concluding, offensive playing style affects physical and technical match performance, but has limited influence on success. Hence, coaches can use the findings to optimize training contents to prepare players for the physical demands of a match.},

	abstract = {Soccer is the world's most popular sport but published research in soccer analytics has yet to attain the same level of sophistication as analytics in other professional sports. We hope to discover new knowledge from a soccer ball-event dataset by applying different machine learning techniques. In this thesis we present three experiments that address three interesting questions in soccer that involve game prediction and team style. We approach each question by constructing features using the ball-event data, where an event is a pass, shot, etc., and applying machine learning algorithms. In the first experiment, we construct three models that use different features to predict which team won a given game, without any knowledge of goals. We achieve a top accuracy rate of 0.84 using an L2-regularized logistic regression classifier. We also investigate the feature weights to learn relationships between game events and a team's chances of success. In the second experiment we try several classifiers to predict which team produced the sequence of ball-events that occurred during a game. Despite the relatively small number of events per game, we achieved an accuracy rate of 0.345 for a 20-team classification task when using a RBF SVM. By learning which sequences are characteristic of teams we are potentially able to discover if successful teams have a common style. We also learn the efficacy of transforming ball-events into predefined symbols. Finally, in the third experiment, we predict which team attempted a given set of passes. We first construct 2D histograms of the locations of the origins of the passes. We then use the histograms as features in a 20-team classification task and discover that teams have characteristic passing styles, by achieving an accuracy rate of 0.735 using a learned K-NN classifier. The results demonstrate that approaching soccer analytics with a machine learning framework is effective. In addition to achieving good classification performance, we are able to discover useful, potentially actionable, knowledge by investigating the models and features that we construct.},

As a result, the factors associated with the defense showed a decisive influence in determining the game results. We analyzed the offense and defense by using the response variable. This showed that the major factors predicting the offense were non-stop pass and attack speed and the major factor predicting the defense were the distance between right and left players and the distance between front line attackers and rearmost defenders during the game.},

	abstract = {To the trained-eye, experts can often identify a team based on their unique style of play due to their movement, passing and interactions. In this paper, we present a method which can accurately determine the identity of a team from spatiotemporal player tracking data. We do this by utilizing a formation descriptor which is found by minimizing the entropy of role-specific occupancy maps. We show how our approach is significantly better at identifying different teams compared to standard measures (i.e., Shots, passes etc.). We demonstrate the utility of our approach using an entire season of Prozone player tracking data from a top-tier professional soccer league.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of playing tactics, opponent interaction and situational variables on achieving score-box possessions in professional soccer. The sample was constituted by 908 possessions obtained by a team from the Spanish soccer league in 12 matches played during the 2009–2010 season. Multidimensional qualitative data obtained from 12 ordered categorical variables were used. Sampled matches were registered by the AMISCO PRO® system. Data were analysed using chi-square analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of 908 possessions, 303 (33.4\%) produced score-box possessions, 477 (52.5\%) achieved progression and 128 (14.1\%) failed to reach any sort of progression. Multiple logistic regression showed that, for the main variable “team possession type”, direct attacks and counterattacks were three times more effective than elaborate attacks for producing a score-box possession (P {\textless} 0.05). Team possession originating from the middle zones and playing against less than six defending players (P {\textless} 0.001) registered a higher success than those started in the defensive zone with a balanced defence. When the team was drawing or winning, the probability of reaching the score-box decreased by 43 and 53 percent, respectively, compared with the losing situation (P {\textless} 0.05). Accounting for opponent interactions and situational variables is critical to evaluate the effectiveness of offensive playing tactics on producing score-box possessions.},
